## RULE 1 - Keep your mind empty
 Throw out everything from your head. Your mind is desired for creative thinking, not for storing data and memorize things.
 You should keep every idea, date, plan of project, shopping list in other place than your head. For example on paper, mobile app.
 Constantly thinking about things that "_you need to remember_" blocks your mind's RAM memory. Process of creative thinking (e.g. problem solving) and process of thinking about thing you need to remember are both interrupting each other.

**Exercise 1**:
- take piece of paper and a pen
- write on it everything you plan to do, every project, meeting, goal or date
- don't pay any atttention to order of your list (it should be priority-free)

**Example**:
```
- run a blog
- buy new computer
- find better job
- visit Italy
- Daria's Birthday Party (05.09)
- buy bananas
- meet John
- be better Son
```

**Exercise 2**:
- take list from _Exercise 1_
- categorize tasks by importance - which of them should be done:
    * Today?
    * Tomorrow?
    * This week?
    * This year?
    * In next 5 years?
    * Optionally? - it will be good to achieve them, but nothing bad happens if they would be never finished
- divide the list into **6** seperate ones, based on criterias from previous point. While writing order the thing by their prorities. Most important things should be on top of a list.
- write potential finish date to each task. Even to those that are really long-term and hard to estimate
