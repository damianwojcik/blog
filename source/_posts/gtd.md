## RULE 1 - Empty mind
Keep your mind empty. Throw out everything from your head. Your mind is desired for creative thinking, not for storing data and memorize things.
You should keep every idea, date, plan of project, shopping list in other place than your head. For example on paper, mobile app.
Constantly thinking about things that "_you need to remember_" blocks your mind's RAM memory. Process of creative thinking (e.g. problem solving) and process of thinking about thing you need to remember are both interrupting each other.

**Exercise 1**:
- take piece of paper and a pen
- write on it everything you plan to do, every project, meeting, goal or date
- don't pay any atttention to order of your list (it should be priority-free)

**Example**:
```
- run a blog
- buy new computer
- find better job
- visit Italy
- Daria's Birthday Party (05.09)
- buy bananas
- meet John
- be better Son
```

**Exercise 2**:
- take list from _Exercise 1_
- categorize tasks by importance - which of them should be done:
    * Tomorrow?
    * This week?
    * This month?
    * This year?
    * In next 5 years?
    * Optionally? - it will be good to achieve them, but nothing bad happens if they would be never finished
- divide the list into **6** seperate ones, based on criterias from previous point. While writing order the thing by their prorities. Most important things should be on top of a list.
- write potential finish date to each task. Even to those that are really long-term and hard to estimate
- put those list to place, from where you can easy access regularly (notepad, phone notepad app)

### Inboxes
You should have as little inboxes as necessary.
You should have easy access to your inboxes and read them regularly.
- physical notepads, calendars or sticky notes
- notes in smart phone
- calendar in smart phone
- any todo app (nozbe / todoist)
- e-mail
- flipboard
- kanban board (trello)
- read later app (pocket)
- youtube watchlater list

## RULE 2 - Prepare for day
The key of effective productivity attitude is to have planned the next day, before going to bed. Effect of this is the right attitude to "_get things done_" right after waking up.

> Every day begins on the evening of the previous day
> -- <cite>Michael Sliwinski, CEO Nozbe</cite>

At the end of the day clear your **todo list** - it is what David Allen calls "_inbox 0_" and prepare new list for upcoming day.

Keep mind about **time buffers** - best way is to schedule no more than **60%** time planned for working. Except urgent jobs and unplanned meetings or calls and dont forget about breaks which will be necessary if your "_power banks level drops_".

## RULE 3 - Tasks 3(1)
For each list (tomorrow / week/ month / year etc.) determine **3 tasks** which MUST be done. From those 3 tasks determine **1 most important task** - which bring you closer to your main goal. This is what "_3(1)_" term stands for. Try to complete this one most important task right in the morning, even before your breakfast ([The ONE Thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ONE_Thing_(book)).

## RULE 4 - Weekly Reviews
Weekly reviews are crucial for proper bringing GTD into life. Plan one day in the week (for me it is sunday) for your review. It is time to stop, look behind and sumamarize progress that happened during the last week. Write down the summary in your journal and wipe up it from your mind memory.
Review all of your lists and goals (update if needed) and prepare new list for upcoming week in right perspective. Clear all junk you gathered during week and wipe up all of your inboxes (most important notes replace with tasks).
Dont be afraid to change your goals and drop away your ideas or change priorities of tasks. You gained more experience and knowledge and now those may change.
Clean not only your mental "things" but also surrounding physical enviroment. Give away or drop to junk devices or clothes you have been not using for years. Clean up your desk. You probably won't need them in the future. Become a minimalist to have less things on mind.

> Clear space mean clear mind.

The more complete your GTD system will be, the more you will be trusting it.
The more you will be trusting it, the more motivated you will be to care of its completness.
Weekly review is key to keep the system on the right level.

Repeatable tasks (daily, weekly) gather into routines. Those routines will soon become your habbits. Keep in mind to developing right habbits and get rid of bad habbits.

## RULE 5 - Natural Planning Model

1. You define your **purpose and principles**. First you ask yourself **why** are you going to do that. Defining a clear and specific goal is common sense and has significant benefits. It allows you to define what is the project success, create a framework to make decisions, think about the needed resources, clarify the focus and awaken your creativity.
You rarely think about your principles consciously, but they exist, and are of particular importance when there are more people involved. You don’t want to reach the result at any cost. If your personal values are violated, you will consider the project as a failure.

2. You **envision the outcome**. This is the **what**. You get a clear picture in mind of what the final result should look like in reality. It must be the best picture possible, with the project completed successfully. This way allows you to activate all the conscious and unconscious resources available to you—ideas, thoughts, patterns

3. Perform a **mindstorm**. Here comes the **how**. Ideas start to pop in your head in a somewhat random order. It is usually an internal process, but if the project is complex, you should capture those ideas using mind-mapping or any other type of technique. This prevents you from forgetting the ideas and helps you to generate new ideas from the original ones.

4. You **organize** everything. Once you know why, what and how, you are able to identify the different components of the project and to define the sequence of activities to be undertaken as well as their priorities.

5. You identify the **next actions**. Finally, you allocate the needed resources to get the project moving. It is about deciding the next actions for each of the moving parts of the project.

> 10 minutes of planing can save you 10 hours of programming

### How to plan?
How intense should we really plan?
- As much as needed to throw out project from your mind. If it still in your mind it means that you still have something to plan about it.

> You can feel good about not doing something only if you know what you aren't doing.
