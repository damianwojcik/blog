Self-discipline and self-development is one of the most important attribute of good programmer and successful people.

<code>"Eat That Frog"</code> is a metaphor introduced by **Brain Tracy** used to describe the most awful action(task) we have to perform during the day. Because what worse can happen to us that day when we just ate the frog?
